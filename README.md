Tested with Netbeans


Two solutions for adding phalcon stubs for your project into github composer or clone+checkout :

Composer 
-----------

The simplest way to install stubs, is to use composer :

Add the line : ```"sneakybobito/phalcon-stubs": "1.2.0"``` in your composer.json and update or install.

You may specify a different version :

```"sneakybobito/phalcon-stubs": "1.1.0"```  ```"sneakybobito/phalcon-stubs": "1.0.0"```




Clone and checkout
-----------

Anywhere in you project you can clone the stubs :

```git clone https://github.com/SneakyBobito/phalcon-stubs.git```

then move to the version you want : 

```git checkout 1.2.0``` or ```git checkout 1.1.0``` or ```git checkout 1.0.0```






Dont forget to add it into you ```.gitignore```
